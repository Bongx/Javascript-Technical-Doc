                        <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular programming language nowadays. It is
                            known as the internet language due the fact that the browser understands
                            JavaScript natively, without installing any plugins in it. JavaScript has grown so
                            much that is no longer just a frontend language; it is also present now on the
                            server (NodeJS), database (MongoDB), and mobile devices and is also used in
                            embedded and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Learning data structures is very important for any technology professional.
                            Working as a developer means you are able to solve problems with the help of
                            programming languages, and data structures are an indispensable piece of the
                            solutions we need to create to solve these problems. Choosing a wrong data
                            structure can also have an impact on the performance of the program we are
                            writing. That is why, it's important to get to know different data structures and
                            how to apply them properly.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Algorithms are the state of art of computer science. There are so many ways of
                            solving the same problem, and some approaches are better than the others. That
                            is why, it's also very important to know the most famous algorithms.
                            This book was written for beginners who want to learn data structures and
                            algorithms and also for those who are already familiar with data structures and
                            algorithms, but want to learn it using JavaScript.
                            Happy coding!</p>

                        <p>JavaScript is a very powerful language. It is one of the most popular languages
                            in the world and is one of the most prominent languages on the internet. For
                            example, GitHub (the world's largest code host, available at https://github.com )
                            hosts over 400,000 JavaScript repositories (the largest number of projects
                            available is in JavaScript; refer to http://githut.info ). The number of projects in
                            JavaScript and GitHub grows every year.</p>
                        <br>
            
                        <p>
                            JavaScript is not a language that can only be used in the frontend. It can also be
                            used in the backend, and Node.js is the technology responsible for this. The
                            number of Node Package Modules (npm), https://www.npmjs.org , has also grown
                            exponentially. JavaScript can also be used for mobile development and is one of
                            the most popular frameworks in Apache Cordova ( https://cordova.apache.org ),
                            which is a mobile hybrid framework that allows developers to code using
                            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allows you to build an app and generate an
                            APK file for Android and IPA file for iOS (Apple). And of course, let's not
                            forget about desktop applications. We can write desktop applications compatible
                            with Linux, Mac OS, and Windows using a JavaScript framework called
                            Electron ( https://electron.atom.io ). JavaScript is also used in embedded and
                            Internet of Things (IoT) devices. As you can see, JavaScript is everywhere!
                            JavaScript is a must-have on your resume if you are or are becoming a web
                            developer.</p>

                            In this chapter, you will learn the syntax and some necessary basic
                            functionalities of JavaScript so that we can start developing our own data
                            structures and algorithms. We will cover:
                            Setting up the environment and JavaScript basics
                            Controlling structures and functions

                        <p>The JavaScript language evolves every year. Since 2015, there has been a new
                            version released every year, which we call ECMAScript, and as JavaScript is a
                            very powerful language, it is also used for enterprise development. One of the
                            capabilities that really helps in this type of development (among other types of
                            application) is typed variables, which we now have, thanks to TypeScript, a
                            superset of JavaScript.</p>

                            JavaScript since 2015, and also the advantages of using a typed version of
                            JavaScript in our projects. We will cover the following:

                        <p>An array is the simplest memory data structure. For this reason, all
                            programming languages have a built-in array datatype. JavaScript also supports
                            arrays natively, even though its first version was released without array support.
                            In this chapter, we will dive into the array data structure and its capabilities.
                            An array stores values that are all of the same datatype sequentially. Although
                            JavaScript allows us to create arrays with values from different datatypes, we
                            will follow best practices and assume that we cannot do this (most languages do
                            not have this capability).</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Let's consider that we need to store the average temperature of each month of the
                            year for the city that we live in. We could use something similar to the following
                            to store this information:
                            <code>
                            const
                            const
                            const
                            const
                            const
                            averageTempJan
                            averageTempFeb
                            averageTempMar
                            averageTempApr
                            averageTempMay
                            =
                            =
                            =
                            =
                            =
                            31.9;
                            35.3;
                            42.4;
                            52;
                            60.8;
                        </code>
                            However, this is not the best approach. If we store the temperature for only one
                            year, we can manage 12 variables. However, what if we need to store the
                            average temperature for more than one year? Fortunately, this is why arrays
                            were created, and we can easily represent the same information mentioned
                            earlier as follows:
                            <code>
                            const averageTemp = [];
                            averageTemp[0] = 31.9;
                            averageTemp[1] = 35.3;
                            averageTemp[2] = 42.4;
                            averageTemp[3] = 52;
                            averageTemp[4] = 60.8;
                            We can also represent the averageTemp array graphically:</p>
                        </code>

                    <article>
                        <p>We learned in the previous chapter how to create and use arrays, which are the
                            most common type of data structure in computer science. As we learned, we can
                            add and remove elements from an array at any index desired. However,
                            sometimes we need some form of data structure where we have more control
                            over adding and removing items. There are two data structures that have some
                            similarities to arrays, but which give us more control over the addition and
                            removal of elements. These data structures are stacks and queues.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The first method that we will implement is the push method. This method is
                            responsible for adding new elements to the stack, with one very important detail:
                            we can only add new items to the top of the stack, meaning at the end of the
                            stack. The push method is represented as follows:
                            push(element) {
                            this.items.push(element);
                            }
                            As we are using an array to store the elements of the stack, we can use the push
                            method from the JavaScript Array class that we covered in the previous chapt</p>

                    <article>
                        <p>A queue is an ordered collection of items that follows the first in, first out
                            (FIFO), also known as the first come, first served, principle. The addition of
                            new elements in a queue is at the tail, and the removal is from the front. The
                            newest element added to the queue must wait at the end of the queue.
                            The most popular example of a queue in real life is the typical line that we form
                            from time to time:
                            We have lines for movies, the cafeteria, and a checkout line at a grocery store,
                            among other examples. The first person in the line is the first one who will be
                            attended to.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            A very popular example in computer science is the printing line. Let's say we
                            need to print five documents. We open each document and click on the Print
                            button. Each document will be sent to the print line. The first document that we
                            asked to be printed is going to be printed first and so on, until all the documents
                            are printed.</p>

                        <p>Arrays (or lists) are probably the most common data structure used to store a
                            collection of elements. As we mentioned previously in this book, each language
                            has its own implementation of arrays. This data structure is very convenient and
                            provides a handy [] syntax to access its elements. However, this data structure
                            has a disadvantage: the size of the array is fixed (in most languages), and
                            inserting or removing items from the beginning or from the middle of the array
                            is expensive, because the elements need to be shifted over (even though we
                            learned that JavaScript has methods from the Array class that will do that for us;
                            this is what happens behind the scenes as well).</p>

                            Linked lists store a sequential collection of elements but, unlike arrays, in linked
                            lists the elements are not placed contiguously in memory. Each element consists
                            of a node that stores the element itself and also a reference (also known as a
                            pointer or link) that points to the next element. The following diagram
                            demonstrates the structure of a linked list:
                            One of the benefits of a linked list over a conventional array is that we do not
                            need to shift elements over when adding or removing them. However, we need
                            to use pointers when working with a linked list and, because of this, we need to
                            pay some extra attention when implementing a linked list. In the array, we can
                            directly access any element at any position; in the linked list, if we want to
                            access an element from the middle, we need to start from the beginning (head)
                            and iterate the list until we find the desired element.</p>

                            We have some real-world examples for linked lists. The first example is a conga
                            line. Each person is an element, and the hands would be the pointer that links to
                            the next person in the conga line. You can add people to the line—you just need
                            to find the spot where you want to add the person, decouple the</p>

                            should sound familiar to you by now. In this chapter, we will cover a data
                            structure called sets, which is also a sequential data structure that does not allow
                            duplicated values. We will learn how to create a set data structure, add and
                            remove values, and search for whether a value already exists. We will also learn
                            how to perform mathematical operations such as union, intersection, and
                            difference. Finally, we will learn how to use the native ECMAScript 2015

                        <p>As we have already learned, a set is a collection of distinct elements (non-
                            repeated elements). A dictionary is used to store [key, value] pairs, where the
                            key could be used to find a particular element. A dictionary is very similar to a
                            set; a set stores a [key, key] collection of elements, and a dictionary stores a
                            [key, value] collection of elements. A dictionary is also known as a map,
                            symbol table, and an associative array.</p>

                        <p>
                            In computer science, dictionaries are often used to store the reference address of
                            objects. For example, if we open the Chrome | Developer tools in the Memory
                            tab and run a snapshot, we will be able to see some objects and their respective
                            address references in the memory (represented by @<number> ).</p>

                    <article>
                        <p>There is a famous programming wisdom quote that says:
                            “To understand recursion, one must first understand recursion.”
                            - Unknown
                            Recursion is a method to solve problems that consist of solving smaller portions
                            of the same problem until you solve the original, larger problem. It usually
                            involves calling the function itself.
                            A method or function is recursive if it can call itself directly, as follows:<br>
                            <code>
                            function recursiveFunction(someParam){<br>
                            recursiveFunction(someParam);<br>
                            }<br>
                            A function is also called recursive if it can call itself indirectly, as follows:<br>
                            function recursiveFunction1(someParam){<br>
                            recursiveFunction2(someParam);<br>
                            }<br>
                            function recursiveFunction2(someParam){<br>
                            recursiveFunction1(someParam);
                            }
                        </code>
                            Suppose we have to execute recursiveFunction . What would the result be? In this
                            case, it would be executed indefinitely. For this reason, every recursive function
                            must have a base case, which is a condition in which no recursive call is made
                            (a stopping point) to prevent infinite recursion.
                            Going back to the mentioned programming wisdom, by understanding what
                            recursion is, we solve the original problem. If we translate this programming
                            wisdom into JavaScript code, we can write it as follows:<br>
                            <code>
                            function understandRecursion(doIunderstandRecursion) {<br>
                            const recursionAnswer = confirm('Do you understand recursion?');<br>
                            if (recursionAnswer === true) { // base case or stop point<br>
                            return true;<br>
                            }<br>
                            understandRecursion(recursionAnswer); // recursive call
                            }
                        </code>
                            The understandRecursion function will keep calling itself until
                            the recursionAnswer is yes ( true ). Having the recursionAnswer as yes is the base case in
                            the preceding code.

                    <article>
                        <p>The top node of a tree is called the root (11). It is the node that does not have a
                            parent. Each element of the tree is called a node. There are internal
                            nodes and external nodes. An internal node is a node with at least one child
                            (7, 5, 9, 15, 13, and 20 are internal nodes). A node that does not have children is
                            called an external node or a leaf (3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, and 25 are leaves).
                            A node can have ancestors and descendants. The ancestors of a node (except the
                            root) are the parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, and so on. The descendants
                            of a node are children (child), grandchildren (grandchild), great-grandchildren
                            (great-grandchild), and so on. For example, node 5 has 7 and 11 as its ancestors
                            and 3 and 6 as its descendants.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Another terminology used with trees is the subtree. A subtree consists of a node
                            and its descendants. For example, the nodes 13, 12, and 14 constitute a subtree
                            from the tree of the preceding diagram.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The depth of a node consists of the number of ancestors. For example,
                            node 3 has a depth of 3 because it has three ancestors (5, 7, and 11).The height of a tree consists of
                            the maximum depth of any node. A tree can also
                            be broken down into levels. The root is on level 0, its children are on level 1, and
                            so on. The tree from the preceding diagram has a height of 3 (the maximum
                            depth is 3, as shown in the preceding figure on level 3).
                            Now that we know the most important terms related to trees, we can start
                            learning more about tree</p>

                        <p>The binary heap data structure
                            The binary heap is a special binary tree with the following two properties:
                            It is a complete binary tree, meaning all levels of the tree have both left and
                            right children (with the exception of the last-level leaves), and the last level
                            has all children as left as possible. This is called as shape property.
                            A binary heap is either a min heap or a max heap. The min heap allows you
                            to quickly extract the minimum value of the tree, and the max heap allows
                            you to quickly extract the maximum value of the tree. All nodes are either
                            greater than or equal to (max heap), or less than or equal to (min heap),
                            each of its child nodes. This is called heap property.</p>

                            Although the binary heap is a binary tree, it is not necessarily a binary search
                            tree (BST). In the binary heap, every child node needs to be greater than or
                            equal to its parent node (min heap) or less than or equal to its parent node (max
                            heap). In the BST, however, the left child is always sma</p>

                        <p>A graph is an abstract model of a network structure. A graph is a set of nodes
                            (or vertices) connected by edges. Learning about graphs is important because
                            any binary relationship can be represented by a graph.
                            Any social network, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google+, can be represented
                            by a graph.</p>

                            We can also use graphs to represent roads, flights, and communications, as

                            Let's learn more about the mathematical and technical concepts of graphs.

                            V: A set of vertices<br>

                            any
                            algorithms.
                            Vertices connected by an edge are called adjacent vertices. For example, A and
                            B are adjacent, A and D are adjacent, A and C are adjacent, and A and E are not
                            adjacent.
                            A degree of a vertex consists of the number of adjacent vertices. For example, A

                            For this reason, among others, we need to organize sets of information, such as
                            the information we have stored in data structures. Sorting and searching
                            algorithms are widely used in the daily problems we have to solve.
                            In this chapter, you will learn about the most commonly used sorting and
                            searching algorithms, such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, shell sort,
                            merge sort, quick sort, counting sort, bucket sort, and radix sort, as well as the
                            sequential, interpolation, and binary search algorithms</p>

                        <p>We do not learn algorithms only because we need to study them in college or
                            want to become developers. You can become a better professional by boosting
                            your problem solving skills using the algorithms you learned in this book as a
                            way of solving problems.
                            The best way of boosting our knowledge in problem solving is practicing, and
                            practicing does not need to be boring. In this section, we will present some
                            websites that you can go to and start having fun with algorithms (and even earn
                            some cash while doing so!).</p>

                        <p>
                            Here is a list of some useful websites (some of them do not support a solution
                            written in JavaScript, but we can apply the logic we discussed in this book to
                            other programming languages as well):
                            UVa Online Judge ( http://uva.onlinejudge.org/ ): This site contains a set of
                            problems used in several programming contests around the world, including
                            the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), which
                            is sponsored by IBM. (If you are still in college, try to participate in this
                            contest and, if your team wins, you can travel around the world with all
                            expenses paid!) This site contains hundreds of problems in which we can
                            use the algorithms learned in this book.
                            Sphere Online Judge ( http://www.spoj.com/ ): This site is similar to UVa
                            Online Judge but supports more languages (including JavaScript
                            submissions).</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Coderbyte ( http://coderbyte.com/ ): This site contains problems (easy,
                            medium, and hard) that can also be solved with JavaScript.
                            Project Euler ( https://projecteuler.net/ ): This site contains a series of
                            mathematical/computer programming problems. All you have to do is input
                            the answer to the problem, but we can use algorithms to find the answer for
                            us.
                            HackerRank ( https://www.hackerrank.com ): This site contains challenges
                            divided into 16 categories (you can use the algorithms that you learned in
                            this book and much more). It also supports JavaScript, among other
                            languages.CodeChef ( http://www.codechef.com/ ): This site also contains several problems
                            and hosts competitions online.
                            Top Coder ( http://www.topcoder.com/ ): This site organizes programming
                            tournaments, usually sponsored by companies such as NASA, Google,
                            Yahoo, Amazon, and Facebook. Some contests give you the opportunity to
                            work with the sponsoring company, and some contests can give you cash
                            prizes. The website also offers great tutorials for problem solving and
                            algorithms.</p>

                        <p>So far, we have had fun discussing how to implement several different data
                            structures and the most commonly used sorting and searching algorithms. An
                            algorithm in the programming world is very interesting. The most beautiful thing
                            about algorithms (and programming logic) is that there is more than one
                            approach to resolving a problem. As we learned in previous chapters, we can
                            design a solution using the iterative approach or make the code easier to read
                            using recursion. There are also other techniques we can use to solve problems
                            with algorithms. In this chapter, we will learn about different techniques, and we
                            will also discuss the next steps in case you are interested in diving deeper into
                            this world.</p>
